Last update: 09.07.2018

§1 Scope of application
--------------

1.1 Validity
--------------

Our General Terms and Conditions in the version valid at the time the order is placed shall apply to all (including future) orders placed by our customers.

If a newer version of our General Terms and Conditions comes into force, this shall apply to an ongoing customer relationship from the point in time at which we made it known to the customer. If the customer objects within the framework of an ongoing business relationship to a new version of our General Terms and Conditions within five working days of notification, our General Terms and Conditions valid up to this point in time in this customer relationship shall continue to apply.

1.2 Terms and conditions of the customer
--------------

Our General Terms and Conditions apply exclusively. Any terms and conditions of the customer shall not apply, even if we have not explicitly objected to them.

§2 Our service
==================

2.1 Portfolio
-------------

In principle we offer the following services:

Consulting, coaching and training services in the field of information technology

Support in the development of a digital strategy

Creation of "tools" in cooperation with the customer

holistic consulting for target-oriented software development

Advice on the selection of service providers and programs

We provide our services personally on site or "remotely" by means of remote data transmission.

We provide our services with the greatest possible care and diligence. Careful analysis of the status quo, drafting an individual target image for the customer and drawing up an implementation plan that gradually introduces the customer and his employees to the target image form the basis of our holistic consulting services.

2.1.1 Example or proof-of-concept code

Unless contractually agreed otherwise, we do not provide independent programming services within the scope of our consulting, training and coaching services; however, within the scope of our activities we often write sample or proof-of-concept code. We expressly point out that we are not liable for example or proof-of-concept code according to 6.2.1.

2.1.2 Tandem or Mob Programming

We supervise the customer's programming work or moderate the cooperation of several programmers (mob-programming). We point out that our liability for these services is limited according to 6.2.2.

2.1.3 Collaboration in agile projects

In agile projects we work exclusively for the respective customer.

The cooperation with external third parties in an agile project takes place exclusively on instruction and in the interest of the respective customer. We do not assume any responsibility for the activity of third parties employed by the customer.

2.2 Scope of Services, Cooperation of the Customer
-------------

The specific services to be provided by us are set out in the respective offer and our order confirmation.

2.2.1 Selection of the consultant
We assign consultants to the individual assignments primarily depending on the specialist area and the time availability.

If the customer prefers a particular consultant, this must be communicated to us prior to the preparation of the offer. Unless our offer assures a specific consultant by name, we can determine which consultant fulfils an order.

Unless otherwise agreed, we shall be entitled to have the contractually agreed services performed in whole or in part by third parties, whereby we shall guarantee the proper fulfilment of the contractual obligations assumed by us.

2.2.2 Cooperation of the customer

Our services require the active cooperation of the customer. Our customers are therefore obliged to provide us with the information and data required to complete the order in good time and to provide us with any necessary working materials, in particular workplaces, to an appropriate extent.

§3 Conclusion of Contract, Changes in Services, Prices
==================

3.1 Offer and conclusion of contract
-------------

3.1.1 Offer and order confirmation

Unless otherwise stated, all our offers are subject to change without notice. A contract is only concluded by our order confirmation.

3.1.2 Text form

The customer's order and our order confirmation must be in text form (§ 126b BGB). Verbal ancillary agreements are only valid if they are confirmed by us in text form.

3.2 Changes in services
-------------

3.2.1 Date postponements

Any postponements requested by the customer are only possible up to four weeks before the confirmed date. A new date must be agreed with us, which - subject to our capacities - may not be more than three months after the original date. It is only possible to postpone an appointment; appointments postponed at the customer's request cannot be postponed again.

Additional costs may arise due to a postponement requested by the customer (rebooking fees):

In the event of a postponement up to eight weeks prior to the assignment, we do not charge any rebooking fees. However, we reserve the right to invoice the customer for all additional travel expenses, in particular all cancellation and rebooking fees incurred by us.

In the event of a postponement up to 6 weeks prior to use, we will charge a rebooking fee of 25% of the offer price. Furthermore, we reserve the right to invoice the customer for all additional travel expenses, in particular all cancellation and rebooking fees incurred by us.

In the event of a postponement up to four weeks prior to use, we will charge a rebooking fee of 50% of the offer price. Furthermore, we reserve the right to invoice the customer for all additional travel expenses, in particular all cancellation and rebooking fees incurred by us.

Under four weeks before the operation, a postponement is no longer possible. If the customer nevertheless waives our services, the agreed price shall be invoiced, whereby any expenses saved by us shall be deducted. The saved expenditure is to be deducted at a flat rate of 15% of the agreed price. The customer shall be entitled to demonstrate and prove higher saved expenses.

3.2.2 Other changes in benefits

If changes to the agreed scope of services requested by the customer and accepted by us, such as, for example, a change of location or a change of consultant, lead to additional expenses on our part, we shall be entitled to invoice the customer for these additionally.

3.3 Fees and travel expenses
-------------

3.3.1 Fee

We charge for our services on the basis of the number of working days per consultant. Unless otherwise agreed, a daily rate of € 1,600 shall apply.

One day's work is 8 hours. The beginning and end of the day of operation as well as break times are arranged according to the customer's needs within the framework of our operational possibilities. An assignment day begins at 08:00 hrs at the earliest and ends at 19:00 hrs at the latest. Unless otherwise agreed, we start work at 09:00 am local time at the site and the day ends at 18:00 pm. Around 12:30 we have a one hour lunch break.

In the case of more than 8 working hours per day, we are entitled to charge the additional working time at 1⁄4 hourly intervals. The 1⁄4-hour is calculated with 1⁄32 of the agreed daily rate.

Shortening of the day of use requested by the customer (through later commencement or earlier termination) shall be at the expense of the customer; we shall neither be obliged to provide subsequent performance nor to reimburse.

If we have to end the last day earlier in order to be able to use a suitable transport connection within the framework of operations lasting several days, this time will be compensated in consultation with the customer by an appropriate combination of earlier start and later termination on the other days.

For work on national holidays or on weekends we charge 100% surcharge on the daily or minute rate.

3.3.2 Travel expenses

Insofar as our offers show travel and incidental expenses, it is a non-binding estimate, as the actual costs incurred are not reliably calculable when preparing the offer. The customer shall bear the actual travel and incidental expenses in accordance with the following provisions against proof.

3.3.3 Handling flat rate

We charge a handling fee of 5% of the travel and incidental expenses incurred on all travel and incidental expenses incurred.

3.3.4 Travel expenses

We regularly organize and book our trips ourselves. We select the means of transport, the place of accommodation and the hotel at our discretion. We make every effort to book a single room in a mid-range hotel that is conveniently located and close to the customer. The outward and return journeys should not exceed 30 minutes. Should this not be possible for reasons for which we are not responsible, we shall be entitled to charge the customer for the entire duration of the daily trips. The agreements on the 1⁄4 hourly rate and the surcharge for weekends and public holidays under 3.3.1 apply accordingly.

In addition, we shall be entitled to charge the times for travel to and from the place of deployment per commenced 1⁄4 hour at a rate of 1⁄64 of the agreed daily rate. On weekends and public holidays throughout Germany, billing will be made for each commenced 1⁄4 hour at 1⁄32 of the agreed daily rate.

For orders placed with the customer, we shall travel at our discretion on the evening before or in the morning of the first day, whereby any overnight costs shall be borne by the customer. Normally we return on the evening of the last working day. In this case it may be necessary to finish the last working day at 17:00 at the latest so that we can reach our transport connection.

3.3.5 Other ancillary costs

Insofar as other ancillary costs (e.g. external services) are incurred, we shall charge these on presentation of proof.

§4 Invoice and payment
==================

4.1 Invoicing
-------------

As a matter of principle, we only issue invoices in Euro. Unless otherwise agreed, our invoices are to be paid within ten days of the invoice date without deductions, exclusively by bank transfer in euros. After expiry of this period, the customer shall be in default of payment without the need for a reminder.

If a customer defaults on payment, we shall be entitled to refuse further services until all our outstanding claims have been settled in full.

4.2 Value added tax
-------------

As our offer is aimed at companies, all prices are quoted exclusive of the applicable statutory value added tax.

If a customer domiciled abroad has a European VAT identification number (VAT ID), this must be communicated to us when placing the order. Otherwise we will invoice the value added tax.

4.3 Advance payments
-------------

We are entitled to demand partial payments or advance payment. Unless otherwise agreed, advance payments must be received in full by us no later than 5 working days before the start of the assignment, otherwise we shall be entitled to withdraw from the contract.

§5 Disturbances and loss of performance
==================

5.1 Force majeure
-------------

5.1.1 Loss of performance due to force majeure

If an order cannot be executed due to force majeure (war, civil war or danger of war or civil war; natural or environmental catastrophes; terror or danger of terror; riot; strike or similar), we and the customer shall be released from the respective obligation to perform. A travel warning issued by the Federal Foreign Office shall also be regarded as force majeure.

5.1.2 Delays

We plan our arrival in such a way that we are punctually at the place of action. However, delays may occur in exceptional cases due to unforeseeable events of force majeure (5.1.1), denied boarding on a flight or rail line, traffic obstructions (e.g. traffic jams or closures) or entry obstructions for which we are not responsible. As far as possible, we endeavour to inform the customer immediately in the event of delays.

If less than eight hours of working time can be worked due to delays, we make up the lost time in consultation with the customer by longer presence. If this should not be possible, the customer can reduce the remuneration for each not performed 1⁄4 hour by 1⁄32 of the agreed daily rate.

If a considerable delay calls into question the sense of an entire assignment, for example, in the case of a delay of several hours in the journey to a one-day assignment, we try to reach the customer and coordinate the procedure with him. If this is not possible for us, we will decide at our own discretion whether to cancel or continue the journey and inform the customer immediately.

5.1.3 Illness

If an order cannot be carried out by us due to illness of an employee, we will inform the customer immediately as soon as this is foreseeable for us. The order is then either carried out in consultation with us at a suitable later date or taken over by another employee.

If an on-site appointment with the customer has to be terminated prematurely due to illness, the customer may reduce the remuneration in accordance with 5.1.2.

For the benefit of the customer, we will bear any additional costs incurred due to higher travel costs or cancellation fees resulting from the case of illness as a gesture of goodwill. If we have rendered more than 50% of the agreed service, the customer shall bear the travel costs.

5.2 Defects in performance for which the customer is responsible
-------------

If, due to circumstances for which the customer is responsible, in particular if the customer does not cooperate or cooperates incompletely, the order cannot be carried out or cannot be carried out completely or has to be cancelled, the customer shall be liable for the full agreed fee.

If the circumstances for which the customer is responsible occur up to two weeks before the agreed deployment, §615(2) BGB does not apply.

Any further claims for damages to which we are entitled shall remain unaffected.

5.3 Default in performance for which we are responsible
-------------

Any disruptions to performance for which we are responsible shall be governed by the statutory provisions subject to the provisions in §6.

§6 Liability
==================

Our liability is limited as follows:

6.1 Limitation of liability
-------------

We shall be liable without limitation only in cases of intent or gross negligence, in cases of injury to life, limb or health or in cases of violation of the provisions of the Product Liability Act.

In the event of a simple negligent breach of an obligation which is essential for achieving the purpose of the contract (cardinal obligation), our liability shall be limited in amount to the damage which is foreseeable and typical according to the nature of the order.

We do not assume any further liability. The above limitation of liability also applies to the personal liability of our employees, representatives or other bodies.

The above limitation of liability shall also apply subsidiarily with regard to the limitations of liability under 6.2.

6.2 Limitation of liability with regard to programming
-------------

6.2.1 No Liability or Warranty for Program Code

We do not provide programming services; however, we often write sample or proof-of-concept code as part of our activities. The customer receives a simple, transferable, non-exclusive right of use, unlimited in time and space, for use in projects and products for all sample code that we create within the scope of training or consulting orders. The transfer is free of charge.

However, we explicitly point out that example code is not production code. The code is not tested or at least not fully tested. In addition, it is not always possible to think through the effects of all possible deployment scenarios in everyday training and consulting.

We therefore accept no liability whatsoever for the general applicability of sample code or its suitability for a particular purpose. The use of sample code is at the customer's own risk.

6.2.2 Limited Liability for Tandem or Mob Programming

As far as we supervise the customer's programming work (tandem programming) or moderate the cooperation of several programmers (mob programming), we are only liable for obvious errors that were introduced into the code during the concrete tandem or mob session.

We shall only be liable for consequential damages if the overall context (purpose of use, dependencies, interfaces, etc.) of the code created by means of tandem or mob programming has been disclosed to us prior to conclusion of the contract.

§7 Mention of references, protection against competition, secrecy
==================

7.1 Reference designation
-------------

We are entitled to name the customer as a reference. The naming takes place among other things under use of the logo or brand name of the customer on our website. The customer may object to this reference when placing the order.

7.2 Competition protection
-------------

We do not accept agreements that prohibit us from acting on behalf of our customers' competitors.

7.3 Confidentiality
-------------

We respect the fact that trade secrets must be protected. Therefore, we normally carry out our activities after signing a confidentiality agreement. However, we cannot accept certain restrictions, such as a general non-competition clause, due to the nature of our business. In order for us to be able to legally check the confidentiality agreements of our customers and clarify any problems in advance, the customer must send us the confidentiality agreement together with the order at the latest.

We are not obliged to sign declarations of confidentiality which were not available to us at the time the order was placed. In the event that a customer insists on the signing of a confidentiality agreement after conclusion of the contract, he shall be in default of acceptance and shall pay the agreed fee even without our performance. In addition, we are entitled to withdraw from the contract. Our right to claim damages shall remain unaffected.

§8 Assignment, set-off
==================

8.1 Prohibition of assignment
-------------

Our customer shall only be entitled to assign his claims arising from the business relationship with us with our consent. Our consent shall only be effective if given in text form.

8.2 Offsetting
-------------

The customer may only declare set-off against undisputed or legally established claims.

§9 Property rights of third parties
==================

Our customer assures us that the software provided by him for the execution of the order is free of rights of third parties or that he may dispose of software.

In the event of an infringement of property rights, the customer shall be obliged to compensate us for any damage and to indemnify us against claims by third parties. If a third party invokes an infringement of property rights, we shall not be obliged to examine the legal situation and shall be entitled without further ado to withdraw from the contract and/or demand damages or security.

Our right to claim damages in all other respects shall remain unaffected thereby.

§10 Final provisions
==================

10.1 Text form
-------------

All changes and additions to contractual agreements must be made in text form (§126b BGB). This also applies to the waiver of the text form requirement.

10.2 Choice of court agreement
-------------

The place of jurisdiction for all disputes with our customers - insofar as the customer is a merchant, a legal entity under public law or a special fund under public law - is Hamburg.

10.3 Choice of law, international jurisdiction
-------------

All relations with our customers shall be governed exclusively by German law to the exclusion of the CISG.

The exclusive international place of jurisdiction is Hamburg.

10.4 Severability clause
-------------

Failure by us to exercise any provision of these Terms and Conditions shall not constitute a waiver of our rights.

If a provision in these terms and conditions is or becomes invalid, the validity of the remaining provisions shall remain unaffected. The Contracting Parties undertake to find a substitute provision which best corresponds to the original economic objective.
